#Scenario
#Imagine a list ‒ not very long, not very complicated, just a simple list containing some integer numbers. Some of these numbers may be repeated, and this is the clue. We don't want any repetitions. We want them to be removed.

#Your task is to write a program which removes all the number repetitions from the list. The goal is to have a list in which all the numbers appear not more than once.

#Note: assume that the source list is hard-coded inside the code ‒ you don't have to enter it from the keyboard. Of course, you can improve the code and add a part that can carry out a conversation with the user and obtain all the data from her/him.

#Hint: we encourage you to create a new list as a temporary work area ‒ you don't need to update the list in situ.

#We've provided no test data, as that would be too easy. You can use our skeleton instead.

my_list = [1, 2, 4, 4, 1, 4, 2, 6, 2, 9]
#
position = []
new_list = []
c = 0
for a in range(len(my_list)):
    if my_list[a] in new_list:
        continue
    else:
        z = 0
        new_list.append(my_list[a])
        x = my_list[a]
        for i in range(len(my_list)):
            if x == my_list[i]:
                z += 1
                if z > 1:
                    #z = 0
                    if i not in position:
                        position.append(i)
                        
position.sort()
for b in range(len(position)):
    del my_list[position[b]-c]
    c += 1

print("The list with unique elements only:")
print(my_list)
